To build a project on Windows you need:
1) Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Libraries:
      pip install discord.py
      pip install youtube_dl
      pip install PyNaCl
3) ffmpeg (included in project)
4) Discord bot token:
      You can create your bot here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
      For first launch you can enter token from stdin or add token to
      main.py -> settings dictionary -> token value, but better if you
      will read token from your $PATH
